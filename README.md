# taskii
A cli task organiser for prioritisation based on motivation

## Description

taskii is aimed to help relieve the stress that comes with prioritising tasks 
based on their urgency, difficulty, and value. As taskii is in the early stages 
of development, there are not many features.

The current version of taskii allows you to add tasks by name, and view the 
current tasks. There is no persistence of tasks yet, or prioritisation. Just a 
way to capture and display tasks held only in the current session.

## Usage

The current usage for taskii is to run the `src/main.py` file. This will place 
you into "edit mode" which accepts only two commands: "add", and "view". The 
command to add will put you into a prompt to write the name of the task, and 
the view command will display all the current tasks.
