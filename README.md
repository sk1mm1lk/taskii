# taskii
A cli task organiser for prioritisation based on motivation

## Description

taskii is aimed to help relieve the stress that comes with prioritising tasks 
based on their urgency, difficulty, and value. As taskii is in the early stages 
of development, there are not many features.

The current version of taskii allows you to add, view, and swap the order of 
current tasks. There is no persistence of tasks yet, or prioritisation. Just a 
way to capture and display tasks held only in the current session.

## Usage

To use taskii in the current stage, execute `src/main.py` and call help to see 
the command options currently.
