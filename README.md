# taskii
A cli task organiser for prioritisation based on motivation

## Description

taskii is aimed to help relieve the stress that comes with prioritising tasks 
based on their urgency, difficulty, and value. As taskii is in the early stages 
of development, there are not many features, but feel free to take a look.

The current version of taskii is very simple and only allows you to add and 
modify the tasks slightly with very basic prompts.

## Usage

To use taskii in the current stage, execute `src/main.py` and call help to see 
the command options currently.

## Adding new functionality

If you copy `src/example.py` and change the values in the file and the reference 
in `src/main.py`
